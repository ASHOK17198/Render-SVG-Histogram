# Visualisation-Of-Histogram

This is example code which runs in client side and is for visualisation of Red channel histogram for 32 bins, using d3- library for rendering SVG graph and it takes data in JSON format. 
data inside json is the result I got when I tried to calculate bucket values for raw image. Presently data is hardcoded by me inside json but latter we can use json parser code for that.
